*Haiiii~ I'm Rin, an ape that is aspiring to become a programmer, I've worked with discord.py and python several times yet I am still on the starter level, surface-level knowledge. I can speak 2 languages and can understand Japanese & German.  One of my long-term goals is to be able to use English on a proffesional level. But my actual goal is to get to someone's - my ideal - level, which gives me all the exuberance and motivation, even if that's ephemeral. I know the basic syntax of C also, and stuff like Kotlin.
But, as I had said, I just know the surface-level knowledge, minimum knowledge in maximum stuff. I'll be using this github profile to record my progress.*

All I expect is **rationality**, and *skillz*. I like to talk about random *rational* stuff as long as people don't just oppose to every single *proven* fact.

I like chess, calculation games, maths, games, & watching anime.
***Thanks for reading~***
